                    Graphics design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving 
                    through the use of typography, photography, icongraphy and illustration. 
                    It is the craft of creating visual content to communicate messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Graphics design is an ancient craft, dating back past Egyptian hieroglphs to 17,000-year-old 
                    cave paintings. As a term originating in the 1920s' print industry and recovering a range of 
                    activities including logo creation, it concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing.

            <article>
                <p> Advances in personal and computing and information technologies have fundamentally
                    how maps are produced and consumed, as many maps today are highly interactive and
                    delivered online or through mobile devices. UI(user interface) / UX(user experience)
                    describes a set of concepts, guidlines, and workflows for critical thinking about design 
                    and use of an interactive product, This entry reviews the conceptual principles behind UI/UX.
                </p>
                <p>UI and UX are not the same, sperated in their focus on interfaces versus interactions. An interface
                    is a tool, and for digital mapping this tool enables the user to manipulate maps and their underlying
                    geographic information. An interaction is broader than the interface, describing the two-way question 
                    answer or request-result dialogue between a human user and a digital object mediated through a computing device.

                <p>You have probably already heard of the term UI and UX, but do you know what that means exactly? The mobile industry
                    is growing very fast. Companies have started content and services through apps. With great mobile app design, you are not only
                    responsible for making a product look beautiful but also building a relationship between app and user. Professional App designers
                    aware of the latest trends. They know how to design an app with an elegant interface, perfect icons, and excellent art.

                <p>
                    Motion graphic design has become a real trend, there is a growing demand among companies to display their products and services with short animations. Except for 
                    marketing purposes, animations are used in video games, applications, banners, animated texts, and subtitles and much more. The huge popularity nowadays has a gif 
                    that is eminently spread among young people. “Motion graphics designer” is a somewhat new specialty for designers, and can be found across all digital platforms, which
                    has created all sorts of new areas and opportunities.

                <p>Color theory is a term used to describe the collection of rules and guidelines regarding the use of color in art and design, as developed since their early days. Color theory informs 
                    the design of color schemes, aiming at aesthetic appeal and the effective communication of a design message on both the visual level and the psychological level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern color theory is heavily based on Isaac Newton’s color wheel, which displays three categories of colors: primary colors (red, blue, yellow), secondary colors 
                    (created by mixing two primary colors), and intermediate or tertiary ones (created by mixing primary and secondary colors). Colors can be combined to form one of five 
                    main color schemes that allow designers to achieve harmony in their designs. These are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analogous: based on three colors located next to each other on the wheel</li>
                    <li>Complementary: one or more pairs of colors that, when combined, cancel each other out (i.e., they produce high contrast)</li>
                    <li>Split-complementary: a combination of the analogous and complementary schemes</li>
                    <li>Triadic: using three colors at equal distances from each other on the wheel</li>
                    <li>Tetradic: using two sets of complementary pairs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below are some color codes that explains HEX colors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Black	#000000	rgb(0, 0, 0)</code></li>
                    <li><code>Red	#FF0000	rgb(255, 0, 0)</code></li>
                    <li><code>Maroon	#800000	rgb(128, 0, 0)</code></li>
                    <li><code>Yellow	#FFFF00	rgb(255, 255, 0)</code></li>
                    <li><code>INDIANRED #CD5C5C RGB(205, 92, 92)</code></li>
